# FIND A POKEMON TRAINER
## https://fast-refuge-13312.herokuapp.com/

## Description:
This app is my first time playing around with express and writting a server with routing and playing with requests and responses.
This was perhaps the hardest concept I have ever come across with the soul exception being defining class in c++ class a decade ago.

routes are cleanly programmed with purpose with catch alls to keep users from ending up at 404 pages, rather I redirect them to the main page.
when the user finishes their quiz and submit the data, a post request is made and routed to the server. This request's body is used to
calculate which other trainers listed in the server are the closest match. this closest match is then returned, unpackaged, and displayed.

Honestly I only undercand about 90% of the program. that final 10% is the result of google searches and finding answers that have been posted
when other people have had similar issues.
